The goal is to design a common interface for different KNP-EMI solvers.

Notes 
* Take the KNP-EMI equations as a starting-point [k]_r, k \in K, \phi_r for r in {i, e} 
* Physical parameters (with units), constant, or regionally or spatially-varying.
  - Constants: gas and Faraday's constant
* Initial conditions for all concentrations and the membrane potential \phi_M = \phi_i - \phi_e 

* Units
